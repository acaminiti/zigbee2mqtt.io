## Notes

### How to create a SONOFF ZBDongle-E Router
You can create a powerful Zigbee router from an ordinary Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus (Model "ZBDongle-E" with EFR32MG21 chip) by flashing a router firmware onto the device. You can find the official guide for flashing the device here: [SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB dongle plus firmware flashing](https://sonoff.tech/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SONOFF-Zigbee-3.0-USB-dongle-plus-firmware-flashing-.pdf). The guide also contains the link to the official [SONOFF Router Firmware for the ZBDongle-E](https://github.com/itead/Sonoff_Zigbee_Dongle_Firmware/tree/master/Dongle-E/Router).
### Hints
The guide from SONOFF is not very detailed. Here are some additional hints:
* First, you have to disassemble the device and pull the logic board out of its housing. You need a **J00 Phillips screwdriver** for this.

* Second, you need a **software supporting the [XMODEM file transfer protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM)** for sending the firmware image to the device.
* Third, you must operate on the naked logic board while it is plugged in. This is a lot easier if you use a **USB extension cable**.
* Forth, to enter the Bootloader Mode, you have to
  * Plug the device in
  * Connect to the device with the serial software (for serial connection parameters, see guide)
  * Press and hold the "BOOT" button (upper button in the lower right corner next to the USB plug in the photo below)
  * and then press the "RST." button (lower button in the lower right corner next to the USB plug in the photo below) to restart the device

* Then follow the steps in the guide to load and install the firmware.
